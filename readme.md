## Version Alpha; December, 2016

The ASW Membership Roster was originally written using Fusebox PHP framework around 2007.  Fusebox PHP has long since disappeared, making the job of maintaining the software more difficult with each passing year.  The new version is based on Laravel 5.2, though it continues to use the same database schema as the original.  This allows users to continue updating while the new software is under development.
